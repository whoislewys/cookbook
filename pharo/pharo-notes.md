#### What is Pharo?
  Pharo is a lot of things

  * Simple dynamic language.

  * Erlang-like hotswap

  * IDE included

  * Nice std library. Now, with FFI! (they say, hopefully it's nice)

* Hippie programmer culture (changes welcome, man)

  * Source control meant to be used with integrated `sources` file

  * [seems super useful ->] Generating image files for live snapshots of a running system.

#### Open Questions

  * Why does it use a VM? Instead of compile to native bytecode?

  * Pattern matching? What does it mean 'receiving object decides what to do with message'?

  * Is Pharo owned by the NSA? why does it need full name to make a method?

  * How does the state persistence work? Is save and quit in Pharo like `Hibernate` or `Sleep` in an OS?

  * Is Smalltalk/Pharo even worth learning?

#### General cool stuff

* Clicking on something brings up snack/toast on keyboard shortcut to do that thing (might be annoying sometime but hey ðŸ¤·)

  * WOWWW Smalltalk came before SQL. Smalltalk dev started in 1969, Codd from IBM published his spec for a RDBMS in 1970. Oracle database (first commercially successful RDBMS) came around 1979.
